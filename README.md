The **LangChain: Chat with Your Data** project on Coursera teaches you how to build a chatbot that interacts with your own data using **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This hands-on project covers:

1. **Document Loading**: Learn to load data from multiple sources using LangChainâ€™s over 80 document loaders.
2. **Document Splitting**: Understand how to effectively break large documents into manageable parts.
3. **Embeddings and Vector Stores**: Dive into embeddings and learn how to store data in a format that allows efficient retrieval.
4. **Question Answering**: Build a system that answers questions based on your data.
5. **Chatbot Creation**: Implement a chatbot that answers queries using the loaded data, rather than relying solely on pre-trained models.

The project is designed for beginners with some basic Python knowledge, offering step-by-step, hands-on learning without the need for additional downloads. This makes it an excellent starting point for those looking to explore how **LLMs (Large Language Models)** can be applied to their own data.
